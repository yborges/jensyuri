<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<!-- source: http://www.longtail.com/about.html-->
<p>Chris Anderson wrote The Long Tail, which first appeared in Wired in October 2004.
    The theory of the long tail says that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a
    relatively small number of "hits" that are the most popular (at the head of the demand curve) to a relatively big
    number of the less popular niches in the tail. He states that the less popular niches can return as much profit as
    the sales of the popular items. It may be hard for physical stores to have such large inventory, due to space
    limitations and storage costs. But for the online stores, it will be a lot easier to handle this broad variety of
    items that customers want because, online stores can have decentralized storages and may be able to buy items
    from retailers when the don't have it in stock.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>Net neutrality is the idea that every website is treated equally and that the web is open to everyone. This means
    that internet service providers cant block or slow particular websites. </p>
<h4>b.</h4>
<p>I agree with the statements in favor of net neutrality because I am not able to think of/find any positive argument
    against net neutrality and I think its very important that small companies/start-ups have a fair change to grow. </p>
<h4>c.</h4>
<p>It is possible that countries from the EU will follow the USA</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>Data.gov is a site from the U.S. government. It's role is to make data of the government accesible to everyone, this
    increases the transparency of the government. Potential dangers of such sites are, that people could easily
    misunderstand meaningful information and threats to privacy.</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>problems in his top 10 that have become rare:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Bad Search</li>
    <li>3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links</li>
    <li>4. Non-Scannable Text</li>
    <li>5. Fixed Font Size</li>
    <li>7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement</li>
    <li>8. Violating Design Conventions</li>
</ul>
<p>One severe usability problem you encounter on current Web sites that is missing from this list is, videos that start
    playing as soon as you enter the site.</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>The first three questions are questions to get morre information about the user who is filling in the survey</p>
<p>The fourth question is a question about the Netflix experience of users in their home country (we need this
    information to know if they have a better or worse experience in foreign countries). The fifth question is a question about the Netflix experience of users in foreign countries (now we can compare
    their home country experience to their foreign country Netflix experience).</p>

<p>sixth and seven question are open because we want to know exactly what they are missing.</p>
