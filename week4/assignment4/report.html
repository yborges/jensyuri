<h4>WCAG</h4>
<!--<p>Accessibility highlights section providing a short discussion of what you identify to be the WCAG guidelines that-->
    <!--are the most relevant to your page (pick 2 or 3)</p>-->

<p>The WCAG guidelines that are the most relevant to our page are Guideline 1.1 and Guideline 1.4.1. Guideline 1.1 is
    relevant to our page because we have a lot of images which is non-text content, and we provided all these images
    with text alternatives. Guideline 1.4.1 is relevant to our page because we did not implement this correctly, the
    font color (green) of the links to the Apple, Samsung, and Huawei websites is not a good combination with the
    background (dark blue and white marble). </p>

    <!--user experience in screen readers, HTML alt tags with short texts describing the image need to be added for all img-->
    <!--elements).</p>-->
