<h1>Lab 2</h1>

<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>We used Safari. By enabling the Develop tab and clicking on JavaScript Console we were able to open the console.
To test console.log() we inserted an external JS file to the index.html and executed console.log("Hello World")
which appeared on Safari's console just fine.</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>We added these lines in js</p>

<pre><code>document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";
   for(i = 0; i < document.getElementsByTagName("a").length; i++) {
    document.getElementsByTagName("a")[i].classList.add("active_links");
}</code></pre>

<p>And this in screen.css:</p>
<pre>    .active_links:active {
    font-size: large;
    color: deeppink;
    }</pre>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>$("a").addClass("active_links");</p>
<p>Pro's:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shorter</li>
    <li>You don't need to loop through all the elements to change things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>learning curve</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>I'm more familiar with Java. The syntax of JS and Java are similar and based on C. Java is pre compiled and therefore
it achieves better performance. Python and JS are interpreted at runtime and are therefore slower. JS relies much
more on callback functions. Java is statically typed whereas Python and JS are dynamically typed, which leads to
more freedom when coding, but that comes with a price: unstructured code.</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>AJAX means Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It is asynchronous because the browser(client) is still able to
perform actions while waiting for a request from the server. It can also be set to synchronous which would lock
the browser until the server responds.</p>
