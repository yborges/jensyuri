<h3>Question 1</h3>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<!-- source: http://www.longtail.com/about.html-->
<p>Chris Anderson wrote The Long Tail, which first appeared in Wired in October 2004.
    The theory of the long tail says that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a
    relatively small number of "hits" that are the most popular (at the head of the demand curve) to a relatively big
    number of the less popular niches in the tail. He states that the less popular niches can return as much profit as
    the sales of the popular items. It may be hard for physical stores to have such large inventory, due to space
    limitations and storage costs. But for the online stores, it will be a lot easier to handle this broad variety of
    items that customers want because, online stores can have decentralized storages and may be able to buy items
    from retailers when the don't have it in stock.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>

<h4>a.</h4>
<p>Net neutrality is the idea that every website is treated equally and that the web is open to everyone. This means
    that internet service providers cant block or slow particular websites. </p>
<h4>b.</h4>
<p>I agree with the statements in favor of net neutrality because I am not able to think of/find any positive argument
    against net neutrality and I think its very important that small companies/start-ups have a fair change to grow. </p>
<h4>c.</h4>
<p>It is possible that countries from the EU will follow the USA</p>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>Data.gov is a site from the U.S. government. It's role is to make data of the government accesible to everyone, this
    increases the transparency of the government. Potential dangers of such sites are, that people could easily
    misunderstand meaningful information and threats to privacy.</p>
