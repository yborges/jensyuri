<h4>WCAG</h4>
<!--<p>Accessibility highlights section providing a short discussion of what you identify to be the WCAG guidelines that-->
    <!--are the most relevant to your page (pick 2 or 3)</p>-->

<p>The WCAG guidelines that are the most relevant to our page are Guideline 1.1 and Guideline 1.4.1. Guideline 1.1 is
    relevant to our page because we have a lot of images which is non-text content, and we provided all these images
    with text alternatives. Guideline 1.4.1 is relevant to our page because we did not implement this correctly, the
    font color (green) of the links to the Apple, Samsung, and Huawei websites is not a good combination with the
    background (dark blue and white marble). </p>

<h4>Improvement plan</h4>
<!--<p>Improvement plan section providing a prioritized list of improvement actions to improve your page, in terms-->
    <!--of- accessibility and usability (based on Appendix A),- other course learning goals (based on Appendix B)- the-->
    <!--selected high lights, and the other material in the appendixes. For each item, describe what you aim to improve,-->
    <!--and what modifications in the HTML, CSS or JavaScript are required to realize the improvement (e.g. to improve the-->
    <!--user experience in screen readers, HTML alt tags with short texts describing the image need to be added for all img-->
    <!--elements).</p>-->
<p>There are some improvement actions that we can do to improve our page, in terms of accessibility and usability
    (based on Appendix A) but not that much. We have listed the improvement actions below: </p>

<ul>
    <li>1. We have to change the color of the links from Apple, Samsung and Huawei</li>
    <li>2. We have to change the title to something that says more about the content of our website.</li>
    <li>3. We should add the ability that people can add an alt for an image in the Top selling models table.</li>
    <li>4. We should add links at the top of the page to each area of the content.</li>
    <li>5. IK WEET NIET WAT ER NOG MEER VERANDERD KAN WORDEN. YURI!?</li>
</ul>

<p>1. We did not change the color, instead we added a beautiful dark gray navigation bar, with the links to Apple,
    Samsung and Huawei. We changed the original links to Test1, 2 and 3 So it is still visible what we changed.</p>
<p>2. Change the title into J&Y phones.</p>
<p>3. We can add the ability that people can add alt for an image in the top selling models table by: BLABLA I DONT
    KNOW. YURI!?</p>
<p>4. We added a dropdown menu in the navigation bar, called sections. In this menu you can quickly go to important
    sections of the webpage.</p>
<p>5. HOE GAAN WE VIJFDE VERBETERPUNT UITVOERE? YURI!?</p>
