<h1>Lab 4</h1>

<h3>Question 1.a.</h3>
<p>There are words in the list that have occured zero times in the text file, like 'iv' and 'ix'.</p>
<h3>Question 1.b.</h3>
<p>What the fuck is a stopword list???????</p>
<h3>Question 1.c.</h3>
<p>No I dont think the top 30 follows Zipf's law, because the first word occurs 2.25 times more than the third word on
    the top 30 (which should be 3 times) and the first word occurs 2.6 times more than the fourth word on the top 30
    (which should be 4 times).</p>
